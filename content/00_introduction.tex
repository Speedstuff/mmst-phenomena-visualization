The human can often be the deciding factor if a process works correctly or not. It can be diffucult to  estimate the outcome certain interactions between human and machine cause. Therefore it is important for the Operator to understand the process he or she is working on.
\newline
This article focuses on visualizing the phenomena happening in a furnace, to give the user an understanding of the system and consequently reduce mistakes, potentially made by an operator.
\newline
The furnace, whom is looked at in this project, has 3 inputs (inlet, air and fuel) and 2 ouputs (outlet and combustion products). The stream gets heated by the energy released from the fuel. It is a simple model and serves as concept to show our tools used to make a process understandable.
