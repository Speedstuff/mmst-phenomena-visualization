## **Discussion **Specific questions to discuss (and then discussed) during the meeting

-   liked the layout
-   connect literature to concept and implentation ⟶ use that in the report
-   pipe is straight just for axure demonstation because of easier for animation
-   validation
    -   power button was tested with users ⟶ best design
-   concept
    -   explain all elemnts which are implemented
    -   not the true process → better to see whats ging on with a straight pipe
-   implementation ⟶ maybe 2 versions with or without bubbles because very inconsistenzt
