## Status Quo What has been done since the last meeting?

-   first animations
-   new furnace design v2

## **Discussion **Specific questions to discuss (and then discussed) during the meeting

-   change background of water → change heat
-   big arrow instead of triangle
-   when water still → WARNING at output stream ⟶ overheating
-   highlight rectangle when overheting warning is displayed
-   make it as easy as possible
-   where to put the warning?
-   when on/off button pressed ⟶ buttons shift all to 0, and you make all disable and grey

    -   [ ] implement arrow off of stream to combustion product
    -   [x] rename geschwindigkeit ⟶ velocity
