# 08.12.21 Wednesday protocol

### When: 2021-12-08 Time: 9:20

## Status Quo What has been done since the last meeting?

-   on/off button
-   title with logos
-   air/fuel reaction → combustion
-   arrows ( two possibilities )

## **Discussion **Specific questions to discuss (and then discussed) during the meeting

-   inderlying function for water inlet outlet stream has to be programmed
-   no physics behind model
-   maybe remove color
-   it would be nice to have many arrows
-   air vs fuel compare → when difference gets bigger combustion gets bigger
-   fuel 80 vs air 20 → uncompleted reaction ⟶ combustion product different
-   quality in combustion
-   remove percentages ⟶ add meaningful values
-   combustion quality in percentage
-   inlet stream in velocity
-   max / med / min marked with colors
-   when maximum reaction reached
-   animation is enough ⟶ dont need outlet view graphs
-   everything is qualitative ⟶ dont need outlet view graphs
-   possible usage for combustion outlet view ( temperature, pressure, quality )

## TO DO Specific tasks assigned during the meeting

@Tamino Schorcht @Felix Mehlhorn

    - [x] arrows ( test two different variants )⟶ see whats best result quantity of arrows vs quality, size, etc...
    - [x] create function for relation between air, fuel and inlet

@Marcus Rothhaupt @Artan Kabashi :

    - [x] combustion product ⟶ grey color
    - [ ] ~~make 3 level view inside of reactor max/min (see below) -~~
        - [ ] ⟶ redundant because of outlet temp indicator
    - [x] outlet stream view graph change to three way indicator cold / med / hot

@X100 :

    - think about project report/ project requirements
    - reasearch
    - literature sources that fit well
