## **Discussion **Specific questions to discuss (and then discussed) during the meeting

-   put triangle into furnace or rectangle ⟶ area = heat
-   fuel, oxygen, heat in a specific relation
-   design colors shouldnt be too much
-   visualize mixing of air and fuel
-   mix before or after furnace entry?
-   air is not from atmosphere, pressurized from oxygen tanks
